## Generative Adversarial Network-based Microstructural profile covariance Analysis Toolbox

GAN-MAT is a comprehensive framework to study brain microstructure in vivo using only the T1-weighted MRI. Out pipeline provides three main features: (1) Synthesis of 3D T2-weighted MRI from 3D T1-weighted MRI using a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN). (2) Calculation of the microstructure-sensitive proxy based on the T1w/T2w ratio using the synthesized T2-weighted MRI. (3) Computation of the ready-to-use microstructural profile covariance (MPC) matrix, microstructural gradient, and moment features.
